## Notes
Some challenges I encountered when building this web application was achieving the correct functionality of the select
element. I was easily able to add an event listener for when the option selected changed, but it took me a while to 
figure out how to re-sort a new list of games when a different button was clicked, but the option selected remained the
same. I encountered challenges with relating applications to one another, such as connecting git to VSCode and pushing
my code to GitHub.
